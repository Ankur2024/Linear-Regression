# Linear Regression Without Scikit-Learn

This repository contains Python code to implement simple linear regression without using the scikit-learn library.

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. In this implementation, we'll be using gradient descent to find the optimal parameters (slope and intercept) for a given dataset.
